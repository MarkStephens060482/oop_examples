## Object-Oriented Programming Examples
Hello and welcome to our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples collection! This place is all about showing you how OOP works through easy-to-understand code examples. Whether you're new to programming or want to get better at OOP, you're in the right spot.

What's Inside
We've organized our examples into different folders, each dealing with a specific OOP idea. Here's what you can find:

Creating Things with Classes: Learn how to make your own types of things called "classes" and make actual things from them called "objects."

Family of Things: Explore how you can create new kinds of things based on existing ones, like making a special type of car from a regular car.

Hiding Secrets: See how to keep some stuff inside your things private so others can't mess with them.

Many Shapes, One Name: Learn how you can use different things in the same way, like using any shape (triangle, square, or circle) the way you use a general "shape."

Getting Abstract: Understand how to make blueprints for things that can't be built directly, like a "shape" that's too vague to be real.

Feel free to explore these examples, look at the code, and try them out. Each folder has a "Read Me" file that explains the idea and how to try it out.

How to Get Started
Ready to dive in? Here's how to get started:

Get the Code: Copy all the code to your computer by clicking the "Download" button.

Pick an Example: Choose the example you're interested in.

Follow the Guide: Open the folder for that example and read the guide inside. It tells you how to use the code and what's happening.

Try It Out: Play with the code! Change things, see what happens. It's the best way to learn.
