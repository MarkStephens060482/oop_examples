        "*Consider the scenario of a senior secondary college  with **Year10** classes, where a **Year10Math**, **Year10English**, **Year10Humanities** and a **Year10Science** are all **Year10** classes. In a Year 10 cohort there are many students and they form 6 different classes each. Each class completes an end of semester examination. Student awards are given to the student of highest achievement and so a rank of best performing students is necessary. Also, the teaches of the classes wish to identify which class achieved the greatest examination performance in order to analyse teacher strategies for revision and exam preparation. This can be done by ranking mean exam score per class and ranking z-score for all students.*   "
